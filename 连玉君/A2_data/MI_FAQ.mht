data?</FONT></H2>MI is not the only principled method for handling =
missing=20
values, nor is it necessarily the best for any given problem. In some =
cases,=20
good estimates can be obtained through weighted estimation procedures. =
In fully=20
parametric models, maximum-likelihood estimates can often be calculated =
directly=20
from the incomplete data by specialized numerical methods, such as the =
EM=20
algorithm. Those procedures may be somewhat more efficient than MI =
because they=20
involve no simulation. Given sufficient time and resources, one could =
perhaps=20
derive a better statistical procedure than MI for any particular =
problem. In=20
real-life applications, however, where missing data are nuisance rather =

preferable to one that is more efficient but problem-specific and =

<H2></A><FONT color=3D#23238e>The imputation model</FONT></H2>In order =
to generate=20
imputations for the missing values, one must impose a probability model =
on the=20
complete data (observed and missing values). Each of our software =
packages=20
applies a different class of multivariate complete-data models. NORM =
uses the=20
multivariate normal distribution. CAT is based on loglinear models, =
which have=20
been traditionally used by social scientists to describe associations =
among=20
variables in cross-classified data. The MIX program relies on the =
<EM>general=20
location model</EM>, which combines a loglinear model for the =
categorical=20
variables with a multivariate normal regression for the continuous ones. =
Details=20
of these models are given by <A=20
href=3D"http://www.stat.psu.edu/~jls/mifaq.html#ref">Schafer (1997)</A>. =
The newer=20
package PAN uses a multivariate extension of a popular two-level linear=20
regression model commonly applied to multilevel data (e.g. <A=20
href=3D"http://www.stat.psu.edu/~jls/mifaq.html#ref">Bryk &amp; =
Raudenbush,=20
1992</A>). The PAN model is appropriate for describing multiple =

<H2></A><FONT color=3D#23238e>What if the imputation model is=20

conform to=20
convenient models such as the multivariate normal. In most applications =
of MI,=20
the model used to generate the imputations will at best be only =
approximately=20
true. Fortunately, experience has repeatedly shown that MI tends to be =
quite=20
forgiving of departures from the imputation model. For example, when =
working=20
with binary or ordered categorical variables, it is often acceptable to =
impute=20
under a normality assumption and then round off the continuous imputed =
values to=20
the nearest category. Variables whose distributions are heavily skewed =
may be=20
transformed (e.g. by taking logarithms) to approximate normality and =

<H2></A><FONT color=3D#23238e>What is the relationship between the model =
used for=20
imputation and the model used for analysis?</FONT></H2>An imputation =
model=20
should be chosen to be (at least approximately) compatible with the =
analyses to=20
be performed on the imputed datasets. The imputation model should be =
rich enough=20
to preserve the associations or relationships among variables that will =
be the=20
focus of later investigation. For example, suppose that a variable =
<EM>Y</EM> is=20
imputed under a normal model that includes the variable <EM>X1</EM>. =
After=20
imputation, the analyst then uses linear regression to predict =
<EM>Y</EM> from=20
<EM>X1</EM> and another variable <EM>X2</EM> which was not in the =
imputation=20
model. The estimated coefficient for <EM>X2</EM> from this regression =
would tend=20
to be biased toward zero, because <EM>Y</EM> has been imputed without =
regard for=20
its possible relationship with <EM>X2</EM>. In general, any association =
that may=20
prove important in subsequent analyses should be present in the =
imputation=20
model.=20
<P>The converse of this rule, however, is not necessary. If <EM>Y</EM> =
has been=20
imputed under a model that includes <EM>X2</EM>, there is no need to =
include=20
<EM>X2</EM> in future analyses involving <EM>Y</EM> unless its =
relationship to=20
<EM>Y</EM> is of substantive interest. Results pertaining to <EM>Y</EM> =
are not=20
biased by the inclusion of extra variables in the imputation phase. =
Therefore, a=20
rich imputation model that preserves a large number of associations is =
desirable=20
because it may be used for a variety of post-imputation analyses.=20
<P>Detailed discussion on the interrelationships between the model used =
for=20
imputation and the model used for analysis is given by <A=20

<A=20
href=3D"http://www.stat.psu.edu/~jls/mifaq.html#ref">Rubin (1996)</A>.=20
<P>Above all, the processes of imputation and analysis should be guided =
by=20
common sense. For example, suppose that variables with skewed, =
truncated, or=20
heavy-tailed distributions are, for the sake of convenience, imputed =
under an=20
assumption of joint normality. Analyses that depend primarily on means,=20
variances, and covariances, such as regression or principal-component =
methods,=20
should perform reasonably well even though the imputer's model is too=20
simplistic. On the other hand, common sense would suggest that the same=20
imputations ought not be used for estimation of 5th or 95th percentiles, =
or=20
other analyses sensitive to non-normal shape.=20

under Bayesian arguments (and they usually are), MI has a natural =
interpretation=20
as an approximate Bayesian inference for the quantities of interest =

useful=20
for evaluating the properties of a given method but provide little =

one seeking to create such a method in practice. For this reason, Rubin=20
recommends that imputations be created through a Bayesian process: =
specify a=20
parametric model for the complete data (and, if necessary, a model for =
the=20
mechanism by which data become missing), apply a prior distribution to =
the=20

the=20

Theorem. In simple problems, the computations necessary for creating =

performed explicitly through formulas. In non-trivial applications, =
special=20
computational techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) must be =

tends to overstate precision because it omits the between-imputation =
component=20
of variability. When the fraction of missing information is small (say, =
less=20
than 5%) then single-imputation inferences for a scalar estimand may be =
fairly=20
accurate. For joint inferences about multiple parameters, however, even =
small=20
rates of missing information may seriously impair a single-imputation =
procedure.=20
In modern computing environments, the effort required to produce and =
analyze a=20
multiply-imputed dataset is often not substantially greater than what is =

required for good single imputation.=20

<H2></A><FONT color=3D#23238e>Is multiple imputation related to=20
MCMC?</FONT></H2>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a collection of =
methods for=20
simulating random draws from nonstandard distributions via Markov =
chains. MCMC=20
is one of the primary methods for generating MI's in nontrivial =
problems. In=20
much of the existing literature on MCMC (e.g. <A=20
href=3D"http://www.stat.psu.edu/~jls/mifaq.html#ref">Gilks, Richardson =
&amp;=20
Spiegelhalter, 1996</A>, and their references) MCMC is used for =
parameter=20
simulation, for creating a large number of (typically dependent) random =
draws of=20
parameters from Bayesian posterior distributions under complicated =
parametric=20
models. In MI-related applications, however, MCMC is used to create a =
small=20
number of independent draws of the missing data from a predictive =
distribution,=20
and these draws are then used for multiple-imputation inference. In many =
cases=20
it is possible to conduct an analysis either by parameter simulation or =
by=20
multiple imputation. Parameter simulation tends to work well when =
interest is=20
confined to small number of well-defined parameters, whereas multiple =
imputation=20
is more attractive for exploratory or multi-purpose analyses involving a =
large=20
number of estimands. Generating and storing 10 versions of the missing =
data is=20
often more efficient than generating and storing the hundreds or =
thousands of=20
dependent draws that would be required to achieve a comparable degree of =

precision through parameter simulation.=20

Rubin (1987)</A>. That is, they assume that missing data values carry no =

information about probabilities of missingness. This assumption is=20
mathematically convenient because it allows one to eschew an explicit=20
probability model for nonresponse. In some applications, however, =
ignorability=20
may seem artificial or implausible. With attrition in a longitudinal =
study, for=20
example, it is possible that subjects drop out for reasons related to =
current=20
data values. It is important to note that the MI paradigm does not =
